2023-09-25T10:21: remaining items for draft v1

it seems like the abstract can actually be well over 100 words...

Title & Abstract -> complete
Introduction -> complete
Experiment & Results -> complete
Dicussion -> complete
figure labels for su8 and bio images -> complete
Conclusion -> complete

items with Scott today:
    1. mention state of the figure 9 laser, 
        a. you follow the cut back according to the slides you showed him last time (pull it up). You've added other quick "functions" to quickly calculate how much to cut on each cut back to target a round trip dispersion value. 
        b. you can't get rid of peak. it looks CW, but not sure what it is, it's not where the CW peak was located prior to mode-locking, off by like 15 nm. and the dispersion balancing is not repeatable between different rep-rates, using gain fiber lengths that shouldn't be an issue.
        c. Tsung-Han still suspects the phase-shifter. A lossy component most generally, phase shifter more specifically. You're holding out on micro-mirror, since you don't think it's been eliminated in the testing process...
        d. told Sichong to priortize other items rather than shadowing you every time you go splice because you think it's not a good learning opportunity to just stand there for hours.

    2. state of paper:
        a. on track to push out draft by end of this evening, sorry got caught up with some paper review and wedding you forgot you were attendign this weekend until Friday

    3. I need a speedtype, hopefully can walk out with one from your meeting with Scott. We need those parts ordered ASAP. 

    4. Nlight did not get back to you, just followed up with a new quotation request today.

Items left to do today:
2023-09-26T16:37:
    1. by the end of today I want to send out an email to Rohith, letting him know that the manuscript is good for a read through

    2. I want to figure out what is the bad component in the laser setup with Tsung-Han, and decide a path forward. 

    3. If I can also get the go-ahead from Scott for the phase-shifter order, that would be great, this needs to be done ASAP

    4. I would also like to get the go ahead to submit order to nlight, then our lab would have a stock of the ER80 and ER110, really cool.

2023-09-26T11:27: it seems that the purchase limit is 10,000 so the optizone order and Nlight orders would be good to go. 

------------------------------
2023-09-28T10:38: 
Items left to do today:
    1. answer Tsung-Han's email -> complete
    2. give Benton some stuff -> working on it...
    3. answer Graeme's email -> complete
    4. revise manuscript, notify Rohith saying you had meant to tell him earlier -> need to do
    5. try another hand at the laser. -> do now? -> complete, no luck :(, spent a while fixing the splicer

Items to do today:
really just two things:
    1. complete read through of reviews -> complete
    2. finish read through and finalize draft -> send out email to Rohith

i recall greg took care of reviewer 1 -> reviewer 1 looks good. i still need to go through supporting information though. Oh okay, actually they're still working on the mass spectrometer part. 

the temp calculation is copy pasted into the response so you read that already

on to reviewer 2...

i agree what i wrote for reviewer 2 was too aggressive, but we should point out that Bjork's work is with a laser with 65 cm^-1, and Luo's work is literally, literally multiplexing EOM's -> he has less than one wavenumber (!) coverage for each one.

reviewer 2 is totally missing the point!

reviewer 3 response looks good, he said to make the time axes the same in one figure by the Lynch group, which hasn't been done. Maybe doesn't have too...

Captions:
Figure 1: one comment to look at again
Figure 2: good
Figure 3: good
Figure 4: one grammar edit
Figure S1: one comment
Figure S2: one comment
Figure S3: good

For Fig. 1 (b) my understanding is that the bandwidth of the low rep-rate DCS is narrower because of the lower rep-rate, whereas the bandwidth for the 10 GHz is narrower because of a narrower spectrum?

Hello Dr. Reddy and Ragib,

Sorry for being late on this, when you have the time may you please take a look at the draft that is on overleaf? I think I've placed in all of the main components now. Look forward to discussing more on Wednesday.

On a separate note, would it be possible to get the raw data for the image in Fig. 5 (d)? I pulled the data off the png file on the ppt slides in order to switch to a different colormap, but it would be better to have the raw data instead. 

Thanks,
Peter

stuff to get done today:
    1. read mass spec papers and possibly write out something

2023-10-03T13:39
Mass spec is impressive, however, it requires photoionization to be able to distinguish different isomers, something which laser spectrosocpy can do directly.

To do this, they need a narrow band (high energy resolution) and broadly tunable VUV (few eV) source -> which means to hit the numbers they cite they need a synchrotron, coupled together with a multiplexed mass spectrometer.

I re-read through my microscopy paper and I think it was ready to send out, so that's good. Better than I thought tbh.

2023-10-03T14:02
Hiyo yong-shing! Happy (th) Birthday! It was great seeing you in Taiwan, I think you grew a solid two feet since I last saw you. I'm sure you're doing great on guitar, and 

2023-10-03T14:04

Tsung-Han, said that he had made like a 237.something MHz laser for a requested application where they wanted the rep-rate to match the transition to within 30 Hz. He said that when he made the 200 MHz oscillator, he thought that it would be easy, and then part way through started thinking jeez how did I get the 237 MHz, this one is so hard lol.

Hi Tsung-Han,

It seems the cleaver cannot cleave unless the tension is almost 400 where the cleave then looks very bad. The cleave starts to improve as you go to lower tension, but it fails to cleave when the tension is still relatively high (~250-300). You can complete the cleave if you pull on the stage a bit to sever the fiber, but the cleave facet is quite inconsistent. This issue persists without much difference in cleave quality as you take the tension down to the target 160-180.

To do items today:
    1. ask nlight for quote of 10 m of Er-110/125-PM
    2. reply Oz-optics email
    3. reply Ana, noting that you know they are currently on break
    4. inquire or place FIS orders.
    6. respond garrett first thing actually. -> complete
    7. inquire about buying extra fiber holder -> complete

Hello Dan,

I wanted to ask if we could buy an additional fiber holder for 250 um coated fibers for the new splicer that we just got for Scott Didddams's lab at CU? We have one that came with the splicer, but it would be more convenient to have two pairs to use around the splicer. 

Thanks,
Peter Chang
