Background-free spectra are particularly important in the fingerprint region (\textasciitilde 800 and 1800 cm-1) where peaks are narrow, closelyspaced, and may be in abundance for a particular chemical. We demonstrate a method for obtaining SRS spectra using a single femtosecond laser oscillator. A photonic crystal fiber is used to create a supercontinuum to provide a range of Stokes shifts from \textasciitilde 300 to 3400 cm-1. This SRS approach provides for collection capabilities that are easily modified between obtaining broadband spectra and single-frequency images.},

  abstract = {In many fields of study, from coherent Raman microscopy on living cells to time-resolved coherent Raman spectroscopy of gas-phase turbulence and combustion reaction dynamics, the need for the capability to timeresolve fast dynamical and nonrepetitive processes has led to the continued development of high-speed coherent Raman methods and new high-repetition rate laser sources, such as pulse-burst laser systems. However, much less emphasis has been placed on our ability to detect shot to shot coherent Raman spectra at equivalently high scan rates, across the kilohertz to megahertz regime. This is beyond the capability of modern scientific charge coupled device (CCD) cameras, for instance, as would be employed with a Czerny-Turner type spectrograph. As an alternative detection strategy with megahertz spectral detection rate, we demonstrate dispersive Fourier transformation detection of pulsed ({$\sim$}90 ps) coherent Raman signals in the time-domain. Instead of reading the frequency domain signal out using a spectrometer and CCD, the signal is transformed into a time-domain waveform through dispersive Fourier transformation in a long single-mode fiber and read-out with a fast sampling photodiode and oscilloscope. Molecular O- and S-branch rotational sideband spectra from both N2 and H2 were acquired employing this scheme, and the waveform is fitted to show highly quantitative agreement with a molecular model. The total detection time for the rotational spectrum was 20 ns, indicating an upper limit to the detection frequency of {$\sim$}50 MHz, significantly faster than any other reported spectrally-resolved coherent anti-Stokes Raman detection strategy to date.},

The combination of the high-coherence dual-comb spectrometer and a reference arm simultaneously enables gas absorption spectroscopy and for the absolute distance information to be obtained in one measurement. As a demonstration, we measure the spectrum of CO2 and CO. From the same interferograms, we demonstrate that distance measurement, by time-of-flight (TOF), can be resolved with an rms precision of 0.53 \textmu m after averaging 140 images and a measurement time of 1 s. Finally, we demonstrate that non-contact surface imaging, using 2D mechanical scanning, reaches lateral resolution of 40 \textmu m. The longitudinal precision is 0.68 \textmu m with a measurement time of 0.5 s. It verifies that DCS has the potential to be applied in standoff detection, environmental pollution monitors, and remote sensing.},

We compare dual-frequency/differential CARS (D-CARS), which enables rapid imaging and simple data analysis, with broadband hyperspectral CARS microscopy analyzed using an unsupervised phase-retrieval and factorization method recently developed by us for quantitative chemical image analysis. Measurements were taken in the vibrational fingerprint region (1200-2000/cm) and in the CH stretch region (2600-3300/cm) using a home-built CARS set-up which enables hyperspectral imaging with 10/cm resolution via spectral focussing from a single broadband 5 fs Ti:Sa laser source. Through a ratiometric analysis, both D-CARS and phase-retrieved hyperspectral CARS determine the concentration of unsaturated lipids with comparable accuracy in the fingerprint region, while in the CH stretch region D-CARS provides only a qualitative contrast owing to its non-linear behavior. When analyzing hyperspectral CARS images using the blind factorization into susceptibilities and concentrations of chemical components recently demonstrated by us, we are able to determine vol:vol concentrations of different lipid components and spatially resolve inhomogeneities in lipid composition with superior accuracy compared to state-of-the art ratiometric methods.},

Many applications in biology and medicine, however, would significantly benefit from a noninvasive imaging technique that circumvents such exogenous probes.               In vivo               microscopy based on vibrational spectroscopic contrast offers a unique approach for visualizing tissue architecture with molecular specificity. We have developed a sensitive technique for vibrational imaging of tissues by combining coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) with video-rate microscopy. Backscattering of the intense forward-propagating CARS radiation in tissue gives rise to a strong epi-CARS signal that makes               in vivo               imaging possible. This substantially large signal allows for real-time monitoring of dynamic processes, such as the diffusion of chemical compounds, in tissues. By tuning into the CH               2               stretching vibrational band, we demonstrate CARS imaging and spectroscopy of lipid-rich tissue structures in the skin of a live mouse, including sebaceous glands, corneocytes, and adipocytes, with unprecedented contrast at subcellular resolution.},

However, the feebleness of Raman scattering significantly limits the use of Raman microscopy to low time resolutions and primarily static samples. Recent developments in narrowband stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy have significantly increased the acquisition speed of Raman based label-free imaging by a few orders of magnitude, at the expense of reduced spectroscopic information. On the basis of a spectral focusing approach, we present a fast SRS hyperspectral imaging system using chirped femtosecond lasers to achieve rapid Raman spectra acquisition while retaining the full speed and image quality of narrowband SRS imaging. We demonstrate that quantitative concentration determination of cholesterol in the presence of interfering chemical species can be achieved with sensitivity down to 4 mM. For imaging purposes, hyperspectral imaging data in the C-H stretching region is obtained within a minute. We show that mammalian cell SRS hyperspectral imaging reveals the spatially inhomogeneous distribution of saturated lipids, unsaturated lipids, cholesterol, and protein. The combination of fast spectroscopy and label-free chemical imaging will enable new applications in studying biological systems and material systems.},

We believe that quantitative multiplex SRS uniquely combines the advantage of fast label-free imaging with the fingerprinting capability of Raman spectroscopy and enables numerous applications in lipid biology as well as biomedical imaging.},

A 27-frame hyperspectral image was acquired of a liquid contaminant on a diffuse gold surface at a range of 5 meters. The measured spectral reflectance closely matches the calculated reflectance.

Here we apply high spectral resolution multiplex coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (MCARS) microspectroscopy in the high wavenumber region to the study of the cell cycle. We show that heterochromatin - the condensed state of chromatin - can be visualised by means of the vibrational signature of proteins taking part in its condensation. Thus, we are able to identify chromosomes and their movement during mitosis, as well as structures like nucleoli and nuclear border in interphase. Furthermore, the specific organization of the endoplasmic reticulum during mitosis is highlighted. Finally, we stress that MCARS can reveal the biochemical impact of the fixative method at the cellular level. Beyond the study of the cell cycle, this work introduces a label-free imaging approach that enables the visualization of cellular processes where chromatin undergoes rearrangements.},

This original design yields two free-running frequency combs having a high level of mutual stability. We developed in parallel a self-correction algorithm that compensates residual relative fluctuations and yields mode-resolved spectra without the help of any reference laser or control system. Fluctuations are extracted directly from the interferograms using the concept of ambiguity function, which leads to a significant simplification of the instrument that will greatly ease its widespread adoption and commercial deployment. Comparison with a correction algorithm relying on a single-frequency laser indicates discrepancies of only 50 attoseconds on optical timings. The capacities of this instrument are finally demonstrated with the acquisition of a high-resolution molecular spectrum covering 20 nm.

While feasibility studies have shown the capabilities of MIR imaging approaches to address key biological and clinical questions, these techniques are still far from being deployable by non-expert users. In this review, we discuss the current state of the art of MIR technologies and give an overview on technical innovations and developments with the potential to make MIR imaging systems more readily available to a larger community. The most promising developments over the last few years are discussed here. They include improvements in MIR light sources with the availability of quantum cascade lasers and supercontinuum IR sources as well as the recently developed upconversion scheme to improve the detection of MIR radiation. These technical advances can substantially speed up data acquisition of multispectral or hyperspectral datasets thus providing the end user with vast amounts of data when imaging whole tissue areas of many mm2. Therefore, effective data analysis is of tremendous importance, and progress in method development is discussed with respect to the specific biomedical context.},

Among the available spectroscopic approaches, GHz MIR dual-comb absorption spectrometers have the potential to simultaneously combine the high-speed, high spectral resolution, and broad optical bandwidth needed to accurately study complex, transient events in chemistry, combustion, and microscopy. However, such a spectrometer has not yet been demonstrated due to the lack of GHz MIR frequency combs with broad and full spectral coverage. Here, we introduce the first broadband MIR frequency comb laser platform at 1 GHz repetition rate that achieves spectral coverage from 3 to 13 \textmu m. This frequency comb is based on a commercially available 1.56 \textmu m mode-locked laser, robust all-fiber Er amplifiers and intra-pulse difference frequency generation (IP-DFG) of few-cycle pulses in {$\chi$}(2) nonlinear crystals. When used in a dual comb spectroscopy (DCS) configuration, this source will simultaneously enable measurements with {$\mu$}s time resolution, 1 GHz (0.03 cm-1) spectral point spacing and a full bandwidth of {$>$}5 THz ({$>$}166 cm-1) anywhere within the MIR atmospheric windows. This represents a unique spectroscopic resource for characterizing fast and non-repetitive events that are currently inaccessible with other sources.},

The duration of the MIR pulse is 13.7 fs, which corresponds to 0.402 cycles. The absolute value of the CEP of the generated sub-half-cycle pulse is consistent with a simple four-wave difference frequency generation model.

On the contrary, MIR microscopy has been rarely used for live biological samples in an aqueous environment due to the lack of spatial resolution and the large water absorption background. Recently, mid-infrared photothermal (MIP) imaging has proven to be applicable to 2D and 3D single-cell imaging with high spatial resolution inherited from visible light. However, the maximum measurement rate has been limited to several frames s               -1               , limiting its range of use. Here, we develop a significantly improved wide-field MIP quantitative phase microscope with two orders-of-magnitude higher signal-to-noise ratio than previous MIP imaging techniques and demonstrate live-cell imaging beyond video rate. We first derive optimal system design by numerically simulating thermal conduction following the photothermal effect. Then, we develop the designed system with a homemade nanosecond MIR optical parametric oscillator and a high full-well-capacity image sensor. Our high-speed and high-spatial-resolution MIR microscope has great potential to become a new tool for life science, in particular for live-cell analysis.},

In this paper the spectral imaging techniques that are based on optical interferometry and nonlinear optics are presented. The interferometric imaging technique is based on the unified theory of Van Cittert-Zernike and Wiener-Khintchine theorems and allows us to retrieve a spectral image of an object in the far zone from the 3D spatial coherence function. The retrieval principle is explained using a very simple object. The promising applications to space interferometers for astronomy that are currently in progress will also be briefly touched on. An interesting extension of interferometric spectral imaging is a 3D and spectral imaging technique that records 4D information of objects where the 3D and spectral information is retrieved from the cross-spectral density function of optical field. The 3D imaging is realized via the numerical inverse propagation of the cross-spectral density. A few techniques suggested recently are introduced. The nonlinear optical technique that utilizes stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) for spectral imaging of biomedical targets is presented lastly. The strong signals of SRS permit us to get vibrational information of molecules in the live cell or tissue in real time. The vibrational information of unstained or unlabeled molecules is crucial especially for medical applications. The 3D information due to the optical nonlinearity is also the attractive feature of SRS spectral microscopy.},

  abstract = {Stimulated Raman scattering microscopy provides a rapid, label-free means of detecting tumor infiltration of brain tissue ex vivo and in vivo.           ,              Virtual Histology             During brain tumor surgery, precision is key. Removing healthy tissue can cause neurologic deficits; leaving behind tumor tissue can allow cancer to spread and treatment to fail. To help the surgeon clearly see tumor versus normal tissue, Ji and colleagues developed a stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy method and demonstrated its ability to identify malignant human brain tissue.                            In SRS microscopy, laser beams are directed at the tissue sample to generate a series of output signals called ``Raman spectra.'' These spectra depend on the molecular composition of the tissue. Ji               et al.               implanted human brain cancer (glioblastoma) cells into mice, allowed them to infiltrate and grow into tumors, and then removed slices for SRS imaging. From the resulting spectra, the authors were able to differentiate the two major components of brain tissue\textemdash lipid-rich white matter and protein-rich cortex\textemdash as well as tumors, which are full of proteins. Intraoperatively, using an imaging window into mouse brains, the authors found that SRS microscopy could locate tumor infiltration in areas that appeared normal by eye, which suggests that this tool could be applied during surgery.                          Imaging fresh tissue slices ex vivo could also complement or perhaps replace standard hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) staining in the clinic because it avoids artifacts inherent in imaging frozen or fixed tissues. To this end, Ji and colleagues showed that SRS microscopy could identify hypercellular tumor regions in fresh surgical specimens from a patient with glioblastoma. Certain diagnostic features were present in these specimens and readily identified by SRS, including pseudopalisading necrosis and microvascular proliferation. The next step will be to apply SRS microscopy to a large collection of human specimens to see whether this technology may be useful in quickly distinguishing glioblastoma from healthy tissue, both outside and inside the operating room.           ,              Surgery is an essential component in the treatment of brain tumors. However, delineating tumor from normal brain remains a major challenge. We describe the use of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy for differentiating healthy human and mouse brain tissue from tumor-infiltrated brain based on histoarchitectural and biochemical differences. Unlike traditional histopathology, SRS is a label-free technique that can be rapidly performed in situ. SRS microscopy was able to differentiate tumor from nonneoplastic tissue in an infiltrative human glioblastoma xenograft mouse model based on their different Raman spectra. We further demonstrated a correlation between SRS and hematoxylin and eosin microscopy for detection of glioma infiltration ({$\kappa$} = 0.98). Finally, we applied SRS microscopy in vivo in mice during surgery to reveal tumor margins that were undetectable under standard operative conditions. By providing rapid intraoperative assessment of brain tissue, SRS microscopy may ultimately improve the safety and accuracy of surgeries where tumor boundaries are visually indistinct.},

Current MIR cameras, however, lack performance and are much less affordable than mature Si-based devices, which operate in the visible and near-infrared regions. Here, we demonstrate fast MIR chemical imaging through non-degenerate two-photon absorption (NTA) in a standard Si-based charge-coupled device (CCD). We show that wide-field MIR images can be obtained at 100\,ms exposure times using picosecond pulse energies of only a few femtojoules per pixel through NTA directly on the CCD chip. Because this on-chip approach does not rely on phase matching, it is alignment-free and does not necessitate complex postprocessing of the images. We emphasize the utility of this technique through chemically selective MIR imaging of polymers and biological samples, including MIR videos of moving targets, physical processes and live nematodes.},

Specifically, SRS in the fingerprint region (400\textendash 1800\,cm               -1               ) can resolve multiple chemicals in a complex bio-environment. However, due to the intrinsic weak Raman cross-sections and the lack of ultrafast spectral acquisition schemes with high spectral fidelity, SRS in the fingerprint region is not viable for studying living cells or large-scale tissue samples. Here, we report a fingerprint spectroscopic SRS platform that acquires a distortion-free SRS spectrum at 10\,cm               -1               spectral resolution within 20\,\textmu s using a polygon scanner. Meanwhile, we significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio by employing a spatial-spectral residual learning network, reaching a level comparable to that with 100 times integration. Collectively, our system enables high-speed vibrational spectroscopic imaging of multiple biomolecules in samples ranging from a single live microbe to a tissue slice.},

In this work, we report three-dimensional sparsely sampled spectroscopic SRS imaging that measures \textasciitilde 20\% of pixels throughout the stack. In conjunction with related work in low-rank matrix completion (e.g., the Netflix Prize), we develop a regularized non-negative matrix factorization algorithm to decompose the sub-sampled image stack into spectral signatures and concentration maps. This design enables an acquisition speed of 0.8\,s per image stack, with 50 frames in the spectral domain and 40,000 pixels in the spatial domain, which is faster than the conventional raster laser-scanning scheme by one order of magnitude. Such speed allows real-time metabolic imaging of living fungi suspended in a growth medium while effectively maintaining the spatial and spectral resolutions. This work is expected to promote broad application of matrix completion in spectroscopic laser-scanning imaging.},

Here, a bidirectional single-cavity dual-comb fiber laser (SCDCFL) is adopted as a DCM low-complexity OFC source. Although the residual timing jitter in the SCDCFL blurs the image of a static object acquired by DCM, computational image correction significantly suppresses the image blur. Nanometer-order step surface profilometry with a 14.0 nm uncertainty highlights the computationally image-corrected DCM effectiveness. We further discuss a possibility to expand the computational image correction to a dynamic object and demonstrate its preliminary experiment.

However, since most FLIMs are based on point-to-point measurements, mechanical scanning of a focal spot is needed for forming an image, which hampers rapid imaging. Here, we demonstrate scan-less full-field FLIM based on a one-to-one correspondence between two-dimensional (2D) image pixels and frequency-multiplexed radio frequency (RF) signals. A vast number of dual-comb optical beats between dual optical frequency combs are effectively adopted for 2D spectral mapping and high-density frequency multiplexing in the RF region. Bimodal images of fluorescence amplitude and lifetime are obtained with high quantitativeness from amplitude and phase spectra of fluorescence RF comb modes without the need for mechanical scanning. The parallelized FLIM will be useful for rapid quantitative fluorescence imaging in life science.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Dual-comb microscopy (DCM), based on a combination of dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) with two-dimensional spectral encoding (2D-SE), is a promising method for scan-less confocal laser microscopy giving an amplitude and phase image contrast with the confocality. However, signal loss in a 2D-SE optical system hampers increase in image acquisition rate due to decreased signal-to-noise ratio. In this article, we demonstrated optical image amplification in DCM with an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA). Combined use of the image-encoded DCS interferogram and the EDFA benefits from not only the batch amplification of amplitude and phase images but also significant rejection of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) background. Effectiveness of the optical-image-amplified DCM is highlighted in the single-shot quantitative nanometer-order surface topography and the real-time movie of polystyrene beads dynamics under water convection. The proposed method will be a powerful tool for real-time observation of surface topography and fast dynamic phenomena.},

We experimentally demonstrate a major benefit of this technique, which is the capability to respond exclusively to the linear Raman-resonance properties of the sample, thus allowing a direct quantitative interpretation of image contrast in terms of the number density of Raman-active modes.},

We show that sequential acquisition of the overall spectrum through a tunable filter, or parallel acquisition of the overall spectrum through a detector array, can significantly improve the SNR under some circumstances. We identify a useful figure of merit as the quality factor, equal to the product of the SNR, normalized by the square root of the acquisition time, and the number of resolved frequency elements.

Among various optical imaging modalities, laser microscopy with fluorescent staining is a powerful method for this purpose. However, it still suffers from the limited applicability and cytotoxicity of a staining process. Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy is an emerging technique of biological imaging based on molecular vibrational contrast, offering new opportunities of biomedical microscopy. In this paper, we introduce the principle and applications of SRS microscopy and discuss various methods of spectral imaging with SRS microscopy. Then, we present our multicolor SRS microscope, which employs a fast wavelength-tunable picosecond Yb fiber laser and a picosecond Ti:sapphire laser. In particular, we describe the technical details of the Yb fiber oscillator, synchronization electronics, high-speed wavelength-tunable filter, video-rate microscope setup and signal detection electronics including the photodetector and the lock-in amplifier. We hope that this paper will be informative for those interested in the application of ultrafast lasers to coherent Raman microscopy including SRS microscopy.},

These modulations are read-out in multi-channel fashion and allow recording of a complete Raman spectrum of the focal region. By raster-scanning the sample, complete Raman images can be obtained.

However, if the optical signal is scattered, as occurs when trying to image tissue, the signal becomes very weak, and it becomes difficult to image a sample with high time resolution.

Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy allows highly sensitive optical imaging based on vibrational spectroscopy without adding toxic or perturbative labels. However, SRS imaging in living animals and humans has not been feasible because light cannot be collected through thick tissues, and motion-blur arises from slow imaging based on backscattered light. In this work, we enable in vivo SRS imaging by substantially enhancing the collection of the backscattered signal and increasing the imaging speed by three orders of magnitude to video rate. This approach allows label-free in vivo imaging of water, lipid, and protein in skin and mapping of penetration pathways of topically applied drugs in mice and humans.},

  abstract = {Terahertz instrumentation has improved significantly in recent years such that THz imaging systems have become more affordable and easier to use. THz systems can now be operated by non-THz experts greatly facilitating research into many potential applications. Due to the non-ionising nature of THz light and its high sensitivity to soft tissues, there is an increasing interest in biomedical applications including both in vivo and ex vivo studies. Additionally, research continues into understanding the origin of contrast and how to interpret terahertz biomedical images. This short review highlights some of the recent work in these areas and suggests some future research directions.},

Artificial intelligence (AI) enables real-time data reduction and imaging of gas concentration based on characteristic molecular absorption signatures.

  abstract = {There is an increasing demand for wavelength agile laser sources covering the mid-infrared (MIR, 3.5\textendash 12 \textmu m) wavelength range, among others in active imaging. The MIR range comprises a particularly interesting part of the electromagnetic spectrum for active hyperspectral imaging applications, due to the fact that the characteristic `fingerprint' absorption spectra of many chemical compounds lie in that range. Conventional semiconductor diode laser technology runs out of steam at such long wavelengths. For many applications, MIR coherent light sources based on solid state lasers in combination with optical parametric oscillators are too complex and thus bulky and expensive. In contrast, quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) constitute a class of very compact and robust semiconductor-based lasers, which are able to cover the mentioned wavelength range using the same semiconductor material system. In this tutorial, a brief review will be given on the state-of-the-art of QCL technology. Special emphasis will be addressed on QCL variants with well-defined spectral properties and spectral tunability. As an example for the use of wavelength agile QCL for active hyperspectral imaging, stand-off detection of explosives based on imaging backscattering laser spectroscopy will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Infrared (IR) spectroscopic imaging systems are a powerful tool for visualizing molecular microstructure of a sample without the need for dyes or stains. Table-top Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) imaging spectrometers, the current established technology, can record broadband spectral data efficiently but requires scanning the entire spectrum with a low throughput source. The advent of high-intensity, broadly tunable quantum cascade lasers (QCL) has now accelerated IR imaging but results in a fundamentally different type of instrument and approach, namely, discrete frequency IR (DFIR) spectral imaging. While the higher intensity of the source provides a higher signal per channel, the absence of spectral multiplexing also provides new opportunities and challenges. Here, we couple a rapidly tunable QCL with a high performance microscope equipped with a cooled focal plane array (FPA) detector. Our optical system is conceptualized to provide optimal performance based on recent theory and design rules for highdefinition (HD) IR imaging. Multiple QCL units are multiplexed together to provide spectral coverage across the fingerprint region (776.9 to 1904.4 cm-1) in our DF-IR microscope capable of broad spectral coverage, wide-field detection, and diffractionlimited spectral imaging. We demonstrate that the spectral and spatial fidelity of this system is at least as good as the best FT-IR imaging systems. Our configuration provides a speedup for equivalent spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to the best spectral quality from a high-performance linear array system that has 10-fold larger pixels. Compared to the fastest available HD FT-IR imaging system, we demonstrate scanning of large tissue microarrays (TMA) in 3-orders of magnitude smaller time per essential spectral frequency. These advances offer new opportunities for high throughput IR chemical imaging, especially for the measurement of cells and tissues.},

This ability to observe structures without destructive fixation or staining has been widely utilized for applications in materials and life sciences. Despite these advantages, phase-contrast microscopy lacks the ability to reveal molecular information. To address this gap, we developed a bond-selective transient phase (BSTP) imaging technique that excites molecular vibrations by infrared light, resulting in a transient change in phase shift that can be detected by a diffraction phase microscope. By developing a time-gated pump\textendash probe camera system, we demonstrate BSTP imaging of live cells at a 50 Hz frame rate with high spectral fidelity, sub-microsecond temporal resolution, and sub-micron spatial resolution.

Using these methods, we demonstrate quantitative mapping of dimethyl sulfoxide concentration in aqueous solutions and in fat tissue. Moreover, MCR is performed on SRL images of breast cancer cells to generate maps of principal chemical components along with their respective vibrational spectra. These results show the great capability and potential of hyperspectral SRL microscopy for quantitative imaging of complicated biomolecule mixtures through resolving overlapped Raman bands.},

This technique offers a lateral resolution of 15\,\textmu m, and the field of view is adjustable between 800\,\textmu m \texttimes{} 600\,\textmu m to 12\,mm \texttimes{} 9\,mm.

Pure band integration of supposedly selective absorption bands for the two constituents of the MLPF is compared to principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate curve resolution (MCR) algorithms regarding the ability to spatially resolve the differently composed areas in the MLPF. While both pure band integration and PCA are strongly affected by common physical artifacts in the spectral data, such as sample tilt, scattering or interference effects, MCR managed to give a clear picture of the composition of the MLPF, which matches the actual situation given by the manufacturing process.
